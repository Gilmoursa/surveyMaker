# surveyMaker

##Just some practice with Angular JS making a survey app. 
###My goal is to have a survey that produces a JSON object which includes:
- [x] title (validate < 100 char)
- [x] pointvalue ( validate > 0)
- [x] description ( validate < 500 char)
- [ ] one or more questions (validate presence of 1+ question)
