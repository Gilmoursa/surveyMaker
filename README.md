# surveyMaker

##Just some practice with Angular JS making a survey app. My goal is to have a survey that produces a JSON object which includes:
 - title (validate < 100 char)
 - pointvalue ( validate > 0)
 - description ( validate < 500 char)
 - one or more questions (validate presence of 1+ question)
